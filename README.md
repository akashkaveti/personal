# Hi! I'm Akash (Kaveti)


This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. The intention behind this to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## Who am I as an Engineer

* Fondness toward automation, hate to do same task second time in the SAME MANNER
* Perfection over hasty finish
* Document what I have done, because eventually ill forget what and how I have done
* Learn with practice
* Simple solution over a complex-one, after all I am an Engineer.
* Love to get mentored and mentor
* Willingness to learn, discuss and teach new technologies
* Want everything to be version controlled or in a declarative manner (Afraid of loosing data)

## Feedback
* Happy to take constructive criticism
* Dont like my work? Let me know why, love to hear your perception
* Prefers Personal feedback (good or bad) than in a group.

## Personality Test
